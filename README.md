# StatisticsWebsite
 This is an interactive website for Statistics Content such as calculating mean, median, mode and other calculations. 
 It uses the framework Streamlit, native CSS and some libraries as seen in the code.
 Unfortunately this version is in portuguese in spite of the requirements.
 For it to run in your machine type 'streamlit run statapp.py' in terminal
